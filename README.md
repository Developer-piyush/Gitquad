# Gitquad Very first step towards decentralizing gitcoin

1) Just deployed this on decentralized cloud that is akash. https://akash.network/
2) Still decentralizing mission part of website is pending, will soon update that too.

Currently its a default unique domain of decentralized cloud, to add custom domain i just have to update some lines of code in dockerfile and need to add cname record in domain dns!

Thank you
